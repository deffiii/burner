          Now the prize fund is formed by the Naziburner team. We block the
          deposit in the smart contract and set the date for the launch of the
          lottery. After that, the contract works completely decentralized.
          Later we will add a feature so that any user can create their own
          lottery with their own prize pool and start date. Follow the news in

          Naziburner is a decentralized lottery based on the Waves blockchain.
          The countdown time is measured in blocks. Each block is closed on
          average in 60 seconds, but there may be a small calculation error.
          Additionally, youâ€™ll need to confirm the transaction and pay the gas
          fee in WAVES. This may take some time. Also, you need to have some
          Waves on your wallet balance to pay gas fees. Remember this when
          choosing a moment to burn your ticket.
